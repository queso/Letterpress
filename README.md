Letterpress by Xolv.io
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/queso/Letterpress.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/queso/Letterpress)

Letterpress allows you to write and publish your own book online with a pretty live-preview
WYSIWYG Markdown editor.

Letterpress is a Meteor application that has been built from scratch using test-driven
development. You can follow a step-by-step guide of how this was done in the
[The Meteor Testing Manual](http://www.meteortesting.com/chapter/letterpress1).
